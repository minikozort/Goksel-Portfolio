In this assignment, I have used the reset.css file for the first time.

I have used many different features of the css to make the website fun, attractive and interactive.

I have used HTML schematics to make sure that the website is searchable and user friendly.

You can look at this simple website and find out a lot about me and my journey to be able to say "I can code".
